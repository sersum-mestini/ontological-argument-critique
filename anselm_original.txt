***Chapter II:***

And so, Lord, you who give understanding to faith, grant me that I may understand, as much as you deem fitting, that you exist as we believe you to exist, and that you are what we believe you to be. Now we believe that you are something than which nothing greater can be thought. Or can it be that a thing of such a nature does not exist, since "the fool has said in his heart, there is no God" (Psalm 14:1)? But surely, when this same fool hears what I am saying—"something than which nothing greater can be thought"—he understands what he hears, and what he understands is in his understanding, even if he does not understand that it exists. For it is one thing for an object to be in the understanding, and another to understand that the object exists. When a painter first conceives of what he will afterwards paint, he has it in his understanding, but he does not yet understand that it exists, because he has not yet painted it. But after he has painted it, he both has it in his understanding and understands that it exists. Even the fool, then, is forced to agree that something than which nothing greater can be thought exists in the understanding, since he understands this when he hears it, and whatever is understood exists in the understanding.

And surely that-than-which-a-greater-cannot-be-thought cannot exist only in the understanding. For if it exists solely in the understanding, it can be thought to exist in reality also, which is greater. If it exists only in the understanding, then that-than-which-a-greater-cannot-be-thought is not that-than-which-a-greater-cannot-be-thought. And this is a contradiction. Hence, there is no doubt that something-than-which-a-greater-cannot-be-thought exists both in the understanding and in reality.
