## Summary of Anselm's Argument

Anselm's ontological argument, presented in *Proslogion* Chapter II, proceeds as follows:

1. **Definition**: God is defined as "something than which nothing greater can be thought." This definition is accepted by both the believer and the fool (atheist) as a coherent concept.

2. **Existence in the Understanding**: When the fool hears this definition, he understands it. Whatever is understood exists in the understanding. Therefore, the concept of a greatest conceivable being exists in the understanding.

3. **Distinction Between Mental and Real Existence**: Anselm distinguishes between an object existing *in the understanding* (as a concept) and existing *in reality*. He illustrates this with the example of a painter: a painting can exist as a concept in the painter's mind before it is realized, but its real existence is a separate matter.

4. **The Core Argument**: If the greatest conceivable being existed *only* in the understanding, we could conceive of a being that is otherwise identical but also exists in reality. Since existence in reality is greater than existence merely in the understanding, this second being would be greater than the greatest conceivable being.

5. **Contradiction**: The assumption that the greatest conceivable being exists only in the understanding leads to a contradiction: it would then be possible to think of something greater (a being that also exists in reality), which contradicts the definition of "that than which nothing greater can be thought."

6. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the greatest conceivable being cannot exist only in the understanding; it must exist both in the understanding and in reality. Hence, God (so defined) exists in reality.

## A Humean Critique: The Limits of Definition

David Hume's empiricist epistemology provides a powerful objection to Anselm's argument. Hume famously distinguished between "relations of ideas" (analytic truths knowable a priori) and "matters of fact" (synthetic truths knowable through experience). The ontological argument attempts to derive a matter of fact (the existence of God) from a mere definition—a relation of ideas. For Hume, no amount of conceptual analysis can establish existence; existence claims must be grounded in empirical evidence. Defining a thing as "the greatest conceivable being" does not guarantee that such a being exists any more than defining a "perfect island" guarantees its existence. The argument commits a category mistake by treating existence as a property that can be logically deduced from a concept, whereas existence is a contingent fact that can only be discovered through observation and experience.

## A Kantian Critique: Existence as a Predicate

Immanuel Kant's critique of the ontological argument centers on his claim that "existence is not a real predicate." In the *Critique of Pure Reason*, Kant argues that existence adds nothing to the concept of a thing; it merely posits that the object corresponds to our concept in reality. When we say "God exists," we are not adding a new property to the concept of God; we are asserting that the concept has an instance in the world. Anselm's argument presupposes that existence is a perfection that can be included in the definition of a greatest conceivable being. But Kant contends that existence is not a property that can be part of a concept's intension. The concept of a hundred thalers does not contain the predicate "exists"; whether those thalers exist or not does not change the concept itself. Therefore, the move from conceiving a greatest conceivable being to asserting its real existence is invalid—existence cannot be derived from mere concepts, no matter how perfect they are conceived to be.
