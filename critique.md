## Summary of Anselm's Argument

Anselm's ontological argument, presented in *Proslogion* Chapter II, proceeds as follows:

1. **Definition**: God is defined as "something than which nothing greater can be thought." This definition is accepted by both the believer and the fool (atheist) as a coherent concept.

2. **Existence in the Understanding**: When the fool hears this definition, he understands it. Whatever is understood exists in the understanding. Therefore, the concept of a greatest conceivable being exists in the understanding.

3. **Distinction Between Mental and Real Existence**: Anselm distinguishes between an object existing *in the understanding* (as a concept) and existing *in reality*. He illustrates this with the example of a painter: a painting can exist as a concept in the painter's mind before it is realized, but its real existence is a separate matter.

4. **The Core Argument**: If the greatest conceivable being existed *only* in the understanding, we could conceive of a being that is otherwise identical but also exists in reality. Since existence in reality is greater than existence merely in the understanding, this second being would be greater than the greatest conceivable being.

5. **Contradiction**: The assumption that the greatest conceivable being exists only in the understanding leads to a contradiction: it would then be possible to think of something greater (a being that also exists in reality), which contradicts the definition of "that than which nothing greater can be thought."

6. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the greatest conceivable being cannot exist only in the understanding; it must exist both in the understanding and in reality. Hence, God (so defined) exists in reality.
